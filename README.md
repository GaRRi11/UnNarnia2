## Description

This is a work-in-progress Unity 3D game project currently focused on building the core game structure and flow before developing full gameplay mechanics.

At this stage, the project includes:

Loading Manager for smooth scene transitions.

Main Menu with navigation to other scenes.

Level Selection Screen (future logic will unlock levels based on progress).

Pause Menu (with resume, restart, and return to main menu options).

Scene Management System with reusable SceneLoader class.

Basic mobile-friendly UI controls for pausing and navigation.

Currently, the gameplay uses Unityâ€™s built-in primitive shapes (cubes, spheres, capsules) to prototype mechanics quickly before importing final 3D assets.
